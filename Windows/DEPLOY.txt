How to deploy:
1. Add to your system PATH (search: edit the system environment variables) Qt bin directory 
(make sure it's the same version that was used during compilation). Example: "C:\Qt\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\bin".
2. Open powershell and go to the folder where you want to deploy application.
3. Copy compiled executable into that folder.
4. Run:
windeployqt.exe --no-system-d3d-compiler --no-opengl-sw --no-translations "FIR Controller.exe"
5. Now copy all dlls (no need for .lib and .exp) from win32/lib folder in application source directory.
6. Copy data directory from "Commons" directory.
7. Sign the executable following instructions in "Code signing.txt".
