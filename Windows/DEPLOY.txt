How to deploy:
1. Add to your system PATH (search: edit the system environment variables) Qt bin directory 
(make sure it's the same version that was used during compilation). Example: "C:\Qt\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\bin".
2. Open powershell and go to the folder where you want to deploy application.
3. Copy compiled executable firgui.exe into that folder.

windeployqt.exe --no-system-d3d-compiler --no-opengl-sw firgui.exe
5. Now copy all dlls from win32/lib folder in application source directory.
6. Copy data and extras directory from "Commons" directory.
7. Change firgui.exe to "Fir Controller.exe".
