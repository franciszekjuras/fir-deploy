How to deploy:
1. Add to your system PATH (search: edit the system environment variables) Qt bin directory 
(make sure it's the same version that was used during compilation). Example: "C:\Qt\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\bin".
2. Open powershell and go to the folder where you want to deploy application.
3. Copy compiled executable into that folder.
4. Run:
windeployqt.exe --no-system-d3d-compiler --no-opengl-sw --no-translations "FIR Controller.exe"
5. Now copy all dlls (no need for .lib and .exp) from win32/lib folder in application source directory.
6. Copy Windows runtime libraries from Windows/SysWOW64 if you compiled 32-bit executable, or Windows/System32 in case of 64-bit executable
(i.e. msvcp140.dll, vcomp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll, where number depends on Visual Studio version used (in this case 2015-2019)). If you're not sure run executable on fresh Windows on virtual machine and see errors or use dependency walker.
7. Build and copy updater executable.
8. Sign the executable following instructions in "Code signing.txt".

!!! DO NOT copy data directory into application archive. This should be distributed separately. !!!
